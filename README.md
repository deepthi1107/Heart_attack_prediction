# Heart_attack_prediction

Used a Supervised Machine Learning model 

Project overview:

-> Prediction of Heart Attacks

Preprocessing of the dataset:

-> Checking and removal of null values

-> Knowing some of the statistical measures

-> Visualizing the data

Data Mining Process:

-> Correlation 

-> Splitting the dataset

-> Training the data 

-> Predicting the output of new data

-> Evaluation of the model

Project Conclusion:

Done EDA on the dataset and used ML algorithm to train the data. predicted the output on new data, found model fits well on the dataset.
